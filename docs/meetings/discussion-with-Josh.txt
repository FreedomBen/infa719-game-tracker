Questions to talk to about with Josh:

1.  Are in-code comments considered good documentation?
2.  If we have a lot of in-code comments that cover security considerations and design details, can we go more higher level with design docs?
3.  Would it be helpful to include comments addressing security concerns that we determined were not applicable but we wanted to indicate to you that we thought about it?
4.  If our chosen framework (in our case Django) includes security features built-in (like CSRF token generation), will we "get credit" for using them as long as we indicate that we did it intentioanlly for security purposes?
